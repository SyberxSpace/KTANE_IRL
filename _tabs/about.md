**Hi there!**

Welcome to my little slice of the internet.

My name is **Nicholas Schwankl**, known in the classroom as **Mr.Sy** and on the internet as **Syber**.

I'm currently working on an undergraduate degree in Technology, Engineering, and Design Education at NC State University and hoping to begin my career outside of school as a public school teacher in North Carolina starting next school year.

## Making
I like to make stuff! I mostly work with 3D printing and Arduino-related DIY electronics, though I dabble in just about everything. My current long-term project is a physical recreation of the game *Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes*.
